## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Products
1. Use admin panel at https://admin.jneoutlet.com
2. Or insert directly into PostgreSQL products table
3. Add product images to `product_images` table
4. Add variants to `product_variants` table if needed

### API Endpoint Development
1. Create route file in `backend/src/routes/`
2. Add route to `backend/src/app.js`
3. Implement business logic in `backend/src/services/` if needed
4. Add validation middleware
5. Update frontend API clients if needed

### Database Changes
1. Create migration file in `database/migrations/`
2. Update main schema in `database/schema.sql`
3. Run migration on production: `docker exec jneoutlet_postgres psql -U jneuser -d jneoutlet -f migration.sql`
4. Update seed data if necessary

### Frontend Updates
1. **Shop Frontend**: Edit `enhanced-shop-frontend.html` and deploy to VPS
2. **Admin Panel**: Update React components in `admin-panel/src/`
3. **Mobile App**: Standard React Native development workflow

### Multi-language Support
- Backend: All text content stored in JSONB fields with language keys
- Frontend: JavaScript object lookups for UI text
- Database: Product names/descriptions in EN/DE/PT
- API responses include all language variants

### Payment Testing
- Use Stripe test cards for payment testing
- Webhook endpoint: `/api/payments/webhook`
- Test in both mobile app and admin panel

### Troubleshooting
- **Shop not loading**: Check nginx status with `docker logs jneoutlet_nginx`
- **API errors**: Check backend logs with `docker logs jneoutlet_backend`
- **Database issues**: Connect via `docker exec -it jneoutlet_postgres psql -U jneuser -d jneoutlet`
- **SSL problems**: Verify Let's Encrypt certificates with `docker exec jneoutlet_nginx ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/live/`
- **Clear caches**: Restart all containers with `docker restart jneoutlet_backend jneoutlet_nginx`
